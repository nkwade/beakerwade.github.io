  <h2>VEX A.I Robotics Competition</h2>
  <p style="text-align": center;"> This new project was an effort between the ACM SIGAI and SIGBots clubs at Purdue. The goal of the project was to create an artificial
                                  intelligence for newly created VEX A.I competition. To do this a team of 6 divided evenly into 3 subteams, computer vision, 
                                 simulation, and data collection and transer. I was on the simulation team focused on creating a simulation in the Unity Game Engine
                                 and training it with their machine-learning agents package. A reinforcement learning approach was taken due to the nature of the robot
                                 competing in a game were picking up rings scores point. I will be leading this project for the 2022-23 competition and plan on 
                                 taking what was learned during our first year and create a more efficient A.I in a shorter timeframe to allow more bug fixing and 
                                 improvement.</p>
